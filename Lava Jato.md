rises, scandals and investigations fascinates me. I guess they give us a glimpse into the machinations of worlds that often seem far from us like high finance or games in politics. I don't remember clearly how, but I found out about this process in brazil that was called "Lava Jato" where from a routine investiagation for money laundering in a carwash in Sao Paulo, became a nation wide scandal 


I started to design the police documents, the logo, the format. I started Designing a whole identity for a nation, I designed other logos of different government branches such as the the parliament. The more i was thinking about it the more complex and huge the project started becoming. I felt it was not elegant or feasable. Beside all of the designs for the world i was building, i was also upposed to write a story that fitted inside that universe
