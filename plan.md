How useful it is to make plans?

I will not plan the story. I will simply [[done|do it]], make various versions of the story and tomorrow, i'll do it again based on client/professor/whoever is grading me [[systems|feedback]].
A pure [[pragmatism|pragmatic]], anti-ideological approach.
I estimated to build a [[modular book]] in two weeks. Did this estimation help me? Look in what situation I'm in...

The best plan is to do as much work as possible in a day, see how much work have I done, and ask myself: "Did I do something wrong? What would I change?"
