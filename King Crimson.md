Legendary English prog rock band. I remember when I listened to 21st Century Schizoid Man for the first time: I knew my life had just changed. It was something I never heard before, the changing tempos, the frenetic drums, the playing with the volume, the distorted vocals. It felt so modern and timeless, I has a feeling that even if the song was released today, it would sound mindblowing. It was relesed in 1968. I once made a game in wich people must guess the year a song was released, the more close, the more points they get. I of course added this song in Everybody was wrong by at least 30 years.

Another record they did was discipline. So simple yet so complex. So approachable to listen to yet so impossible to play.
A musician has three disciplines, the discpline of the heands, and by extesions the whole body. head: organizing the mind and hold on the pattern, your attention is spread 16 bars ahed and before [[meditation]], that collapes on a single moment, this way one has a view of the whole and of the detail. the heart, the relationship with the music.

it's clear that there is an interest in holism, the hands are part of whole: the body, the hand cannot function well if the entire [[system]] is not healthy and again to play music one must have a discipline on the body, heart and mind, one must commit entirely
there is an entirely differrent perception of what music is about
