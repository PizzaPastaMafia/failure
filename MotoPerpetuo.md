Some weeks ago I went to this fetish party not too far from where I live.
I kinda knew what I was excpecting and the thing that interested me the most
were the dark rooms, these little private room where people can satisfy their kinks.
I had no interest in partecipate in any "activity" but I was also moved by morbid curiosity.
Who are these people? Why do they obsess to wear latex and leather like motocyclists form the eighties? 
What kind of sick unwatchable things do they performed in those obscure little chambers filled
with contraptions that could only come out of those medieval torture chambers?
As scholar of human behaviour it was my duty to find out, to set foot in the underground, where 
no bourgeois daddy's sons that likes to dance to Il Pagante would never dare to thread. 
In order to know them I also needed to imitate them, dress like them, think like them.
Those were kind of parties where people put a lot of importance on their appearance, it's how
they set themselves apart, they are not afraid of wearing the most forbidden clothings, or lack
thereof.
Not surprisingly those collection of harnesses, latex bodies and other various costumes are rather
exclusive to come by, both by price and by location, what kind of respectable and famous chain
of clothing would gamble its reputation on selling clothes so despised by any red blodded hard working
family man or woman?
Due to my monetary difficulties and admitted ingorance of the right outfit i was supposed to wear
and, even if I knew, where could I possibly find those exotic dresses?
I had to resort to creativity, hack something so I could be sure of that I would be granted access
to the alluring dark rooms. In my attic I found a pair of abandoned pantyhoses that I knew that 
could become useful. After a proper washing, I cut a hole to fit my head through and streched
the part that would normally cover the lower abdomen, to my bare torso. After some added cutting,
some light makeup and nail polish. For my bottom I kept it simple by just wearing my carpenter 
jeans and black All Stars and was ready to go. As I was watching myself in the mirror I felt an
enormous sense of accomplishment, a feeling that years before I was so accostumed, now 
almost entirely lost. I used to study computer science in high school and for how much I loved
the subject I had a natural adversionn to study. I don't know if I have some kind ADHD, but I 
find it physically and mentally excurciating to forcing myself to sit and read. So, I
simply stopped studying, I just played around with esoteric coding languages, explored endless 
wikipedia rabbit holes and in tests, I would just generally learn about the subject,
understand what the teacher wanted to hear, and preatty much talked about what I was interested in, 
instead of the actual topic of the test. I could not really know how to describe this approach, 
I would just call it "minimum effort, maximum yield" and I was also bitterly crticized for it.
People would call me lazy. Me? Lazy? Just because I have fun in what I'm working on, just because 
I'm more efficent than you, just becuase I know the rules and know how to exploit them, I'm supposed to be lazy?
Instead of me being lazy, maybe you are the one doing everything wrong. How is Maximum effort, 
minimal yield smarter? These people feel a need to work, not having fun, not solving problems,
just working for the sake of it. I think they feel some kind of sense of purification when they
endure their daily self inflicted curse and I belive the less they like their job, the bigger contribute
to society they think they produce.
Anyway, In one of my late night Wikipedia explorations I came about an article that talked about
hacks at the MIT. Practical jokes that the students of the prestigous american college would pull.
The more sophisticated and original the prank is, the more praise from the community it would get.
The most classic one involved placing a police car with flashing light on top of the college' 
Great Dome. The car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match 
the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was pi. Its license plate read "IHTFP", 
the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside 
with mug of coffee and a box of donuts.
Others that I personally find amazing are using the lights of a building to play tetris and filling the 
entire college park with garden gnomes.
Why would some people in their right mind would ever perform these dumb pranks? Don't they have anything better to do?
Because they are not like anybody else, those are hackers, they are not motivated by money or anything 
else other than the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective 
engineering, both technical and social. They see a problem and they just have fun solving it.
I know this feeling. The sweet dopamine rush when you see your elegant solution solving a problem that 
haunts you from days, sometimes even or week. It's a feeling that not even the best and purest 
crack can give you and the more elegant and ingenius the solution is, the more satisfaction you feel. 
It really is a drug, you immediately look for the next mental challenge, the next high, so much so that 
you start to create your own problems to solve just to then show off to other like minded addicts.
I guess this is the cigarette after sex equivalent for nerds. 
While still high from the dopamine my brain released after watching my outfit at the mirror, I set
to go explore these uncharted territories.
As soon as I arrived, I already started to notice some interesting behaviour, a guy with manners with 
and language that could've come out of the victorian era asked this domnitrix a hand kiss while
she was resting her legs to a poor guy held by lace.
After entering, paying and travelling the hall towards the techno room, all while reciving some filtry
looks and giggles that felt to me rather welcoming, I placed myself in my usual spot right in front of
the subwoofers, where the low basses muted any stupid though I had in mind. "Let loose" I kept saying to
myself, while flinching some momentary gazes in the environmnet around me. These gazes cought a very 
cute girl that apparently was having lots of fun from the characteristically repetitive music. By lowering
my sight to her feet, I noticed she probably was having more fun by stomping a guy layed on the ground.
He was called "The Human Carpet". There were also a couple of performers, one for example, used a cotton
to leave traces of alcohol on a naked woman layed on a bed, he than would set fire to the alcohol causing
her to feel spasms.
I don't take the presumption to criticize anybody, but I could feel bad vibe everywhere. Not that it wasn't
a safe space, it just wasn't my place they weren't my people. The tipping point was when I finnaly fell
in that magical state that music like techno can induce. I didn't need to make conscious movements in order
to dance, i just left the body and the pulse do its thing, it moved by itself. Sometimes I would turn
around and see people getting spanked. What the fuck is this? Who are these people? What am I doing here? 
I had to leave. Madness. Pure madness. Everything was so decadent, I unfortnately can't seem to appreciate this
attitude of partying for the sake of it. Not anymore at least. Isn't there something beyond all of this?


I had a vague idea of what to expect, but what intrigued me most were the dark rooms—those little private spaces where people indulge their kinks. I had no intention of participating in any "activities," but I was driven by a morbid curiosity. Who are these people? Why are they so obsessed with wearing latex and leather, like motorcyclists from the eighties? What unspeakable, bizarre acts do they perform in these dimly lit chambers filled with contraptions that seem plucked from medieval torture devices?

As a scholar of human behavior, I felt it was my duty to explore, to venture into this underground realm where no bourgeois daddy’s boy grooving to _Il Pagante_ would dare to tread. To understand them, I knew I needed to mimic them—to dress like them, think like them. These were the kind of parties where appearance was everything, where people set themselves apart by donning the most daring outfits, or lack thereof.

Unsurprisingly, these collections of harnesses, latex bodysuits, and other costumes are hard to come by—exclusive both in price and in where they’re sold. What respectable, mainstream clothing brand would risk its reputation selling such taboo attire? The kind of clothes loathed by every red-blooded, hard-working family man or woman?

Faced with monetary constraints and ignorance of what exactly I should wear—and even if I knew, where could I find such exotic outfits?—I resorted to creativity. I hacked together something that I hoped would grant me access to those alluring dark rooms. In my attic, I found a pair of abandoned pantyhose. After giving them a proper wash, I cut a hole for my head and stretched the part that normally covered the lower abdomen over my bare torso. A few additional cuts, some light makeup, and nail polish completed the look. For the bottom, I kept it simple—my carpenter jeans and black All Stars.

As I stared at myself in the mirror, I felt an enormous sense of accomplishment, a feeling I hadn’t experienced in years. In high school, I used to study computer science. I loved the subject but had a natural aversion to studying. I don’t know if I had some form of ADHD, but sitting and reading felt physically and mentally excruciating. So, I stopped. Instead, I played with esoteric programming languages, explored endless Wikipedia rabbit holes, and, during tests, learned enough to understand what the teacher wanted to hear. Then, I’d talk about whatever interested me instead of the actual topic of the exam.

I called this approach “minimum effort, maximum yield.” It worked, but people criticized me. They called me lazy. Me? Lazy? Just because I had fun with what I was working on? Just because I was more efficient than they were? Just because I understood the rules and exploited them? I wasn’t lazy. Maybe they were the ones doing it wrong. How is “maximum effort, minimal yield” smarter? These people seemed to take pride in suffering through work they didn’t enjoy, as if their misery made their contributions to society more valuable.

Anyway, one late night, during a Wikipedia dive, I stumbled upon an article about MIT hacks—elaborate pranks pulled off by students at the prestigious American college. The more sophisticated and original the prank, the more admiration it garnered. One classic involved placing a gutted police car, meticulously painted to resemble an MIT campus patrol vehicle, atop the Great Dome. The car’s number was pi, and its license plate read “IHTFP,” the abbreviation for MIT’s unofficial slogan. A dummy dressed as a campus patrol officer sat inside, holding a coffee mug and a box of donuts.

Other pranks included using a building’s lights to play Tetris and filling an entire college park with garden gnomes. Why would anyone bother with such ridiculous stunts? Don’t they have better things to do? The answer is simple: they’re hackers. They’re not motivated by money or recognition but by the sheer joy of creating something new and executing it with ingenuity—both technical and social. They see problems and solve them for fun.

I know this feeling. The dopamine rush when your elegant solution works after days—or weeks—of mental torment. Nothing compares to it. The more ingenious the solution, the greater the satisfaction. It’s addictive, like a drug. You start seeking the next challenge, the next high, even creating problems just to solve them. It’s the nerd equivalent of a cigarette after sex.

Still riding the high from my improvised outfit, I set off to explore these uncharted territories. As soon as I arrived, I noticed peculiar behaviors. A man, speaking with Victorian-era manners, asked a dominatrix for a hand-kiss while she rested her legs on another man bound by lace.

After entering, paying, and walking toward the techno room—receiving some flirty looks and giggles that felt oddly welcoming—I positioned myself in my usual spot, right in front of the subwoofers. The low bass drowned out any lingering thoughts. “Let loose,” I kept telling myself as I glanced around. One of those glances caught a girl who seemed to be having a blast with the repetitive beats. When I looked down at her feet, I realized she was stomping on a man lying on the ground. He was called “The Human Carpet.”

There were performers, too. One was dabbing alcohol onto a naked woman lying on a bed, then setting it alight, causing her to spasm.

I don’t presume to judge anyone, but I couldn’t shake a bad vibe. Not that it wasn’t a safe space—it just wasn’t _my_ space. These weren’t my people. The tipping point came when I finally reached that magical state where techno music makes your body move without thought. But every so often, I’d turn around and see someone getting spanked.

What the hell was this? Who were these people? What was I doing here?

I had to leave. Madness. Pure madness. Everything was so decadent. Unfortunately, I can’t seem to appreciate this attitude of partying for the sake of it—not anymore, at least. Isn’t there something beyond all of this?
