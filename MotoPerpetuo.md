Some weeks ago I went to this fetish party not too far from where I live.
I had a vague idea of what to expect, but what interested me most were the dark rooms—those little private spaces where people satisfy their kinks. I had no intention of participating in any "activities," but I was driven by a morbid curiosity. Who are these people? Why are they so obsessed with wearing latex and leather, like motorcyclists from the eighties? What sick, unspeakable, acts do they performed in those obscure little chambers filled with contraptions that could only come out of those medieval torture chambers?

As a scholar of human behavior, I felt it was my duty to explore, to venture into this underground realm where no bourgeois daddy’s boy grooving to _Il Pagante_ would dare to tread. To understand them, I knew I needed to mimic them—to dress like them, think like them. These were the kind of parties where appearance was everything, where people set themselves apart by showing off the most daring outfits, or lack thereof.

Unsurprisingly, these collections of harnesses, latex bodysuits, and other costumes are hard to come by—exclusive both in price and in where they’re sold. What respectable, mainstream clothing brand would risk its reputation selling such taboo attire? The kind of clothes loathed by every red-blooded, hard-working family man or woman?

Faced with monetary constraints and ignorance of what exactly I should wear—and even if I knew, where could I find such exotic outfits?—I resorted to creativity. I hacked together something that I hoped would grant me access to those alluring dark rooms. In my attic, I found a pair of abandoned pantyhose. After giving them a proper wash, I cut a hole for my head and stretched the part that normally covered the lower abdomen over my bare torso.
For the bottom, I kept it simple—my carpenter jeans and black All Stars. A few additional cuts, some light makeup, and nail polish completed the look. 

As I stared at myself in the mirror, I felt an enormous sense of accomplishment, a feeling I hadn’t experienced in years. In high school, I used to study computer science. I loved the subject but had a natural aversion to studying. I don’t know if I had some form of ADHD, but sitting and reading felt physically and mentally excruciating. So, I stopped. Instead, I played with esoteric programming languages, explored endless Wikipedia rabbit holes, and, during tests, learned enough to understand what the teacher wanted to hear. Then, I’d talk about whatever interested me instead of the actual topic of the exam.

I called this approach “minimum effort, maximum yield.” It worked, but people criticized me. They called me lazy. Me? Lazy? Just because I had fun with what I was working on? Just because I was more efficient than they were? Just because I understood the rules and exploited them? I wasn’t lazy. Maybe they were the ones doing it wrong. How is “maximum effort, minimal yield” smarter? These people seemed to take pride in suffering through work they didn’t enjoy, as if their misery made their contributions to society more valuable.

Anyway, one late night, during a Wikipedia dive, I stumbled upon an article about MIT hacks—elaborate pranks pulled off by students at the prestigious American college. The more sophisticated and original the prank, the more admiration it garnered. One classic involved placing a gutted police car, meticulously painted to resemble an MIT campus patrol vehicle, atop the Great Dome. The car’s number was pi, and its license plate read “IHTFP,” the abbreviation for MIT’s unofficial slogan. A dummy dressed as a campus patrol officer sat inside, holding a coffee mug and a box of donuts.

Other pranks included using a building’s lights to play Tetris and filling an entire college park with garden gnomes. Why would anyone bother with such ridiculous stunts? Don’t they have better things to do? The answer is simple: they’re hackers. They’re not motivated by money or recognition but by the sheer joy of creating something new and executing it with ingenuity—both technical and social. They see problems and solve them for fun.

I know this feeling. The sweet dopamine rush when your elegant solution solving a problem that haunted you after days, sometimes even weeks. It's a feeling that not even the best and purest crack can give you. The more ingenious the solution, the greater the satisfaction. It’s addictive, like a drug. You start seeking the next challenge, the next high, even creating problems just to solve them. I guess It’s the nerd equivalent of a cigarette after sex.

Still riding the high from my improvised outfit, I set off to explore these uncharted territories. I noticed some odd behaviors as soon as I arrived. A man, speaking with Victorian-era manners, asked a dominatrix for a hand-kiss while she rested her legs on another man bound by lace.

After entering, paying, and walking toward the techno room—receiving some flirty looks and giggles that felt oddly welcoming—I positioned myself in my usual spot, right in front of the subwoofers, where the low basses muted any stupid though I had in mind. “Let loose,” I kept telling myself as I glanced around. One of those glances caught a girl who seemed to be having a blast with the repetitive beats. When I looked down at her feet, I realized she was stomping on a man lying on the ground. He was called “The Human Carpet.”

There were performers, too. One was dabbing alcohol onto a naked woman lying on a bed, then setting it alight, causing her to spasm.

I don't take the presumption to criticize anybody, but I could feel bad vibes everywhere. Not that it wasn’t a safe space—it just wasn’t _my_ space. These weren’t my people. The tipping point came when I finally reached that magical state where techno music makes your body move without thought. But every so often, I’d turn around and see someone getting spanked.

What the hell was this? Who were these people? What was I doing here?

I had to leave. Madness. Pure madness. Everything was so decadent. Unfortunately, I can’t seem to appreciate this attitude of partying for the sake of it—not anymore, at least. Isn’t there something beyond all of this?


I remember the first time I listened to King Crimson' Discipline for the first time. Those infinitely repetitive angular guitar riffs with . I knew my life from that moment, would change.
The absolute genius of this record is its simplicity. Take a look at the script of "Frame by Frame", Robert Fripp plays only a four note pattern but it plays it in such a staggering speed that almost nobody can even come close.
He stripped music to its very core and
