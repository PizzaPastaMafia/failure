Some weeks ago I went to this fetish party not too far from where I live.
I kinda knew what I was excpecting and the thing that interested me the most
were the dark rooms, these little private room where people can satisfy their kinks.
I had no interest in partecipate in any "activity" but I was also moved by morbid curiosity.
Who are these people? Why do they obsess to wear latex and leather like motocyclists form the eighties? 
What kind of sick unwatchable things do they performed in those obscure little chambers filled
with contraptions that could only come out of those medieval torture chambers?
As scholar of human behaviour it was my duty to find out, to set foot in the underground, where 
no bourgeois daddy's sons that likes to dance to Il Pagante would never dare to thread. 
In order to know them I also needed to imitate them, dress like them, think like them.
Those were kind of parties where people put a lot of importance on their appearance, it's how
they set themselves apart, they are not afraid of wearing the most forbidden clothings, or lack
thereof.
Not surprisingly those collection of harnesses, latex bodies and other various costumes are rather
exclusive to come by, both by price and by location, what kind of respectable and famous chain
of clothing would gamble its reputation on selling clothes so despised by any red blodded hard working
family man or woman?
Due to my monetary difficoulties and admitted ingorance of the right outfit i was supposed to wear
and, even if I knew, where could I possibly find those exotic dresses?
I had to resort to creativity, hack something so I could be sure of that I would be granted access
to the alluring dark rooms. In my attic I found a pair of abandoned pantyhoses that I knew that 
could become useful. After a proper washing, I cut a hole to fit my head through and streched
the part that would normally cover the lower abdomen, to my bare torso. After some added cutting,
some light makeup and nail polish. For my bottom I kept it simple by just wearing my carpenter 
jeans and black All Stars and was ready to go. As I was watching myself in the mirror I felt an
enormous sense of accomplishment, something that years before I was so accostumed, now 
almost entirely lost. I used to study computer science in high school and for how much I loved
the subject I had a natural adversionn to study. I don't know if I have some kind ADHD, but I 
find it physically and mentally excurciating to forcing myself to sit and read. So, I
simply stopped studying, I just played around with esoteric coding languages, explored endless 
wikipedia rabbit holes and in tests, I would just read about the generally learn about the subject,
understand what the teacher wanted to hear, and preatty much talked about what I was interested in, 
instead of the actual topic of the test. I could not really know how to describe this approach, 
I would just call it "minimum effort, maximum yield" and I was also bitterly crticized for it.
People would call me lazy. Me? Lazy? Just because I have fun in what I'm working on, just because 
I'm more efficent than you, just becuase I know the rules and know how to exploit them, I'm supposed to be lazy?
Instead of me being lazy, maybe you are the one doing everything wrong. How is Maximum effort, 
minimal yield smarter? These people feel a need to work, not having fun, not solving problems,
just working for the sake of it. I think they feel some kind of sense of purification when they
endure the 
Anyway, In one of my late night Wikipedia explorations I came about an article that talked about
hacks at the MIT, practical jokes that the students of the prestigous american college would pull.
The more sophisticated and original the prank is, the more praise from the community it would get.
The most classic one involved placing a police car with flashing light on top of the college' 
Great Dome. he car was found to be a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match 
the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was pi. Its license plate read "IHTFP", 
the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside 
with mug of coffee and a box of donuts.
Others that I personally find genius is using the lights of a building to play tetris and filling the 
entire college park with garden gnomes.
Why would some people in their right mind would ever perform these dumb pranks? Don't they anything better to do?
Because they are not like anybody else, those are hackers, they are not motivated by money or anything 
else other than the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective 
engineering, both technical and social. They see a problem and they just have fun solving it.
I know this feeling, the sweet dopamine rush when you see your elegant solution solving a problem that 
haunts you from, sometimes even days or week. It's a feeling that not even the best and purest 
crack can give you and the more elegant and ingenius the solution is, the more satisfaction you feel. 
It really is a drug, you immediately look for the next mental challenge, the nexthigh, so much so that 
you start to create your own problems to solve just to then show off to other like minded addicts.
I guess this is the cigarette after sex equivalent for nerds. 
While still high from the dopamine my brain released after watching my outfit at the mirror, I set
to go explore these uncharted territories.
