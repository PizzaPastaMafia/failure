# this is a project about failures
i failed in many ways this semester, I want to turn these failures into setbacks
I am in a rush against time. The choices I made from writing this come from pure necessity. I ~~want~~ need to sleep.
I like financial crises and not only
Mani Pulite, 2008 crisis, lava jato. Cases I studied for countless hours 
a project about a detective that collects evidence on a corruption case. Suspect's IDs, government documentation, various evidence of different nature and marginalia like in House of Leaves. that's how you were supposed to learn the story
I started to work on it I realized it was not feasible. Too much work
No more top down design. start small and let complexity emerge.
Modularity allows you to think in minimal terms. Add modules to add complexity -> modular book
Talking Heads used a technique to make a "groove based" music: rhythm first
They had a very layered sound by making jam sessions and sampled some sequences they liked: very simple grooves e.g. a single note or chord repeated. Then, they layered these patterns: more layers, more tension
I wanted the reader to be obsessed and hypnotized by my book, like I am when I listen to their songs
No cover on my book, there is no start or end in modularity but everything is connected
Ring binding allows for infinite possibilities, way more than swiss or glue. Quick changes, economic and minimal. As long as there is a hole, it can be part of the book. A truly hackerable binding
David Byrne, singer of Talking Heads, left the lyrics for last thing: he sung nonsense that fit the music and eventually substituted into something that made sense. He calls it emergent storytelling and the music composition? modular music
Everything that has the word "Emergent" and modular in it has my immediate attention. Two of my obsessions.
Done manifesto:"if you wait more than a week to get an idea done abandon it"
"In two weeks I will have the basis for my book ready, then, it will all be downhill" I said. Two week passed, I was empty handed
I didn't totally abandon it, I'd say transformed.
Moto Perpetuo, the three minute arpeggio in King Crimson' song "Fracture", also the name of my project
**image of moto perpetuo page**
Started as placeholder, became the basis for the project.
I essentially copied what King Crimson did in the song Discipline. Go listen to it
Moto represent Robert Fripp guitar, Perpetuo Adrian Belew's

|Belew|Fripp|
|5/8  |5/8  |
|5/8  |4/4  |

Discipline works for the tension made from the interlocking of the two guitars with different time signatures
my attempt was to make a story not with characters, plot or events, just tension
Each "moto" or "perpetuo" represent a note that Fripp and Belew play. There are hundreds if not thousands of notes played in Discipline but with a simple script I wrote, I programmed all the time signatures and in seconds I can design dozens of pages in seconds

How time signatures work:
note that the groupings of notes can be changed within the tempo. this is a tecnique King Crimson uses to add texture and tension

Graphical tension can be achived between juxtapoing element with different proprieties.
having dozens of pages with just "Moto Perpetuo" in different sizes or color was still pretty boring.
**various examples**
I gave another shot to the purely modular book before Moto Perpetuo, now I something to talk about: duality. "No", Stephan said "you like to know how the creative process work". Both Themes were arbitrary and still no idea how to talk about them, doomed to fail
I gave up after tried to divide every single element into a module. even sentences.
Discipline is never an end in itself, only a means to an end
After 40 years, the pizzeria "Da Rosanna e Maurizio" in Colloredo di Prato (~2000 inhabitants), ceased activity. 6 months later, another pizzeria opened called "Da Dani"
I was desperate to find something to work on, I thought I could use design to tell a story instead of using a story for design something
In two days and a sleepless night, I started, developed and discarded a project. 
I was told that a graphical identity is not a good mean to deliver a story, I was risking too much.
I can't afford to be empty handed one and a half months before the examination date. 
Problem solving is the most valuable thing i learned studying computer science in high school
This project is the most difficult problem I had to solve.
I had to question my way of working and my problem solving approach itself
I do not tolerate banality
I do have things to say but I struggle on how to say them
I noticed an extreme confusion on how I talked: stutters, fillers and hesitations caused a lack of momentum and rhythm. 
I couldn't find a framework in the way I wrote the stories and in how to visually represent them.
Every work, no matter how short or antilinear, needs momentum; the momentum of the short-short is lyrical in nature - "what does this mean?" - rather than narrative in nature: "What happens next?"
The solution: reduce the words, go straight to the point.
I struggled for months in finding a proper story to tell and a way to tell it. 
It wouldn't make sense to let my failures go to waste
Minimalism is not the end, but the starting point.
Everything I learned in 20 years of my life and all the setbacks that I racked up in the last months, led me to write this final line.
