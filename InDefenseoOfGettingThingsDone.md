Done is the engine for more

The point of getting things done is not to finish, the point is to do it again. Better.

Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

Solve the parts, not the whole

Moore's law: the number of transistors in a microprocessor doubles every 18 months. The world is exponentially accelerating. We need to develop products in less and less time

Over there, in that general direction

**Calculus** is the mathematical study of continuous change, integral calculus studies approximations of areas and volumes

The conscious and lucid decision of committing suicide is mind-blowing to me. It's a huge statement to say "Fuck you, it's my life, I decide when to end it". Most people don't want to think about death, they don't want any control over it. They want an external factor to decide for them. But he woke up everyday and said: "Not today, I choose to live". He lived because he wanted to.

From the beginning we were never interested in big ideas, that's what set us apart. A starting point, a different attitude. Work from what's in front of you - author from that.

If I have many ingredients in my refrigerator, I can cook everything I want. But some ingredients may never be used. If I find only a carrot inside, I must cook it in the best way possible by chopping, grating, roasting, boiling, frying, drying, etc. With many ingredients I would probably never discover that the carrot itself can be such a delicious ingredient.

These purely manual interventions all respect one single formal rule: nothing is removed, nothing is added, “No More, No Less”. Constraints is what makes art interesting I choose to making time my constraint.

Economy and elegance of design due to constraints ("salvation through suffering").

The idea is that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
