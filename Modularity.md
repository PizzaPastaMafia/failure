I think there is a misconception that reductionism, usually associeted with modularity is opposed to holism.
I think that they are codependent and the face of the same coin. A system emerges form the interrelation of its parts.
In a most elegant system, the modules, like an equation or a [[unix]] program are self contained, still they need to communicate with the rest of the system in order to have a purpose. 
Reductionism and holism are just tools, one help us to see the detail, another to see the bigger picture.
